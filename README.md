# Aanagrammatics

Anagrammatics is an open-source mini tool to practice anagrams. For example: "O, Draconian Devil" could be an anagram of "Leonardo Da Vinci". Engaging in anagrams can provide an enjoyable pastime during your leisure moments.

I had a fondness for anagrams since my childhood. And recently I became acquainted with AlipineJS and felt compelled to incorporate this technology into projects aligned with my ideas. Consequently, I embarked on a rather basic experiment with AlpineJS, complemented by TailwindCSS (CDN) for enhancing the visual aesthetics.

## Shortfall

Many things are not working, and I'm eager to learn those. There exist several aspects of User Experiences (UX) that continue to fall short of my expectations. Hopefully inshaALLAH, in a future version, I will be able to fix those.

## Hope

I find AlpineJS a good thing to try for smaller projects like this.
